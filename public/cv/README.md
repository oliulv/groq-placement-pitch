# CV Folder

Place your CV PDF file here and name it `oliver-cv.pdf`.

The file will be accessible at `/cv/oliver-cv.pdf` and can be downloaded/viewed from the website.

**To update:**
1. Add your PDF file to this folder (`public/cv/oliver-cv.pdf`)
2. The links on the site will automatically work

**Alternative:** If you want to use a different filename, update the path in `lib/constants.ts`:
```typescript
cv: "/cv/your-filename.pdf"
```
